## How It Works

1. **Login & Identification:**  
   Vertex Hub uses Discord authentication to securely identify you within our system.

2. **Resource Analysis:**  
   Once logged in, select your resource folder. The tool automatically locates your server configuration (cfg) and detects the resources in use. If it doesn't, you can always select it manually.

3. **File Processing & Merging:**  
   Click the **"Process Files"** button. Vertex Hub scans your files, identifies duplicates. You can click "merge" button to proceed with merging process. Vertex Hub sends conflicting files to our servers for processing and merging.

4. **Integration:**  
   After processing, you’ll receive a link to the merged files. Simply drag and drop these files into your server folder and update your configuration file. **Important:** Alawys start vertex-hub resource in the end of the cfg, or you will see issues.

5. **Credit System:**  (currently disabled)
   Every merge operation uses credits. Credits are calculated based on the number of conflicting files that require merging. You can acquire credits by subscribing to one of our flexible subscription plans.

## Important Notes

- **Do Not Rename:**  
  After integrating the merged files, ensure that the folder name remains unchanged. Renaming the folder may result in configuration errors.
- **Add last in cfg:**  
  You must always keep vertex hub last in the cfg.
- **LodLights merge:** If you see lodlights floating even after the merge, you would need to manually find duplicates of lodlights ymaps you have and remove them, sorry for inconvenience
