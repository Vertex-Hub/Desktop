## Key Features

- **Effortless Mod Compatibility:**  
  Integrate maps, props, collisions, occlusions, and more with just a few clicks.
  
- **Automated File Processing:**  
  Automatically scans your server files to find and merge duplicates.
  
- **Discord Authentication:**  
  Securely log in using your Discord account for a seamless user experience.
  
- **Credit-Based System:**

## How It Works

1. **Login & Identification:**  
   Vertex Hub uses Discord authentication to securely identify you within our system.

2. **Resource Analysis:**  
   Once logged in, select your resource folder. The tool automatically locates your server configuration (cfg) and detects the resources in use. If it doesn't, you can always select it manually.

3. **File Processing & Merging:**  
   Click the **"Process Files"** button. Vertex Hub scans your files, identifies duplicates, and sends them to our servers for processing and merging.

4. **Integration:**  
   After processing, you’ll receive a link to the merged files. Simply drag and drop these files into your server folder and update your configuration file. **Important:** Do not rename the folder, as this may cause integration issues.

5. **Credit System:**  
   Every merge operation uses credits. Credits are calculated based on the number of conflicting files that require merging. You can acquire credits by subscribing to one of our flexible subscription plans.
